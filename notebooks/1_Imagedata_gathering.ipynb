    "- This project aims to develop a real-time dangerous animal detection system using YOLO (You Only Look Once) with deep learning and big data processing techniques. The system is designed to enhance public safety by detecting potentially hazardous animals such as snakes, scorpions, and wolves through camera feeds. The dataset, consisting of both real-world and augmented images, is preprocessed using PySpark to ensure consistency in format, resolution, and quality. Various augmentation techniques, including motion blur, are applied to improve performance in dynamic environments. The model is trained with YOLOv8 to enhance detection accuracy under different conditions."

    "### `Step-1` : Gathering Dataset\n",
    "- The dataset includes eight selected dangerous animal classes that are commonly seen in public areas: bear, crocodile, hawk, lion, scorpion, snake, spider, and wolf. To gather the dataset, images were sourced from `Google Images`, `Pexels`, and `Unsplash`. For Google Images, the GoogleImageCrawler library was used to automate the downloading process. For Pexels and Unsplash, a developer account was created to obtain an API key for downloading images. Approximately 3,000 images were collected in total."
